#Matrix:

#Simple codes of R to understand in better way

m1<- matrix(c(T,F,F,T), nrow=2)
m1

m2<- matrix(c(T,T,F,F,F,T), nrow = 3)
m2

#Another way to create a matrix

m3<- matrix(c("a","b","c","d"), nrow = 2)
m3

m4<- matrix(c("a","b","c","d"), nrow = 2, byrow = T) #Here we have given True statement for printing the character in row format
m4
